    TODO: Before you release your application, you need a Google Maps API id.

    To do this, you can either add your release id credentials to your existing
    id, or create a new id.

    Note that this file specifies the API id for the release build target.
    If you have previously set up a id for the debug target with the debug signing certificate,
    you will also need to set up a id for your release certificate.

    Follow the directions here:

    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/signup

    Once you have your id (it starts with "AIza"), replace the "google_maps_key"
    string in this file.

        YOUR_KEY_HERE
    </string>
